#We create the app by running the create_app function and passing in the configuration name.
# We get this from the OS environment variable FLASK_CONFIG. 
# Because we are in development, we should set the environment variable to development.

#We have created a migrate object which will allow us to run migrations using Flask-Migrate. 
# We have also imported the models from the app package.

#Migrations allow us to manage changes we make to the models, and propagate these changes in the database. 
#For example, if later on we make a change to a field in one of the models, 
# all we will need to do is create and apply a migration, and the database will reflect the change.

#Weâ€™ll begin by installing Flask-Migrate, which will handle the database migrations using Alembic, 
# a lightweight database migration tool. Alembic emits ALTER statements to a database thus implememting changes made to the models. 
# It also auto-generates minimalistic migration scripts, which may be complex to write.
